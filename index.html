                    <h3>Hello! I’m Bhuwan Shrestha.</h3>
                    <p>Embarking on the journey of software engineering, I've found a profound connection between the logic 
                        of code and the creativity of solving real-world problems. From my early days of curiosity about how 
                        applications transform our daily lives to becoming a dedicated Software Engineering Student, my path 
                        has been anything but ordinary. With each project, I strive to blend technical skills with innovative 
                        solutions, aiming to make technology more accessible and impactful.</p>

                    <p>My academic journey has been a tapestry of rigorous learning and practical application, where I've 
                        not only mastered programming languages but also learned to think critically about their application. 
                        Whether it's developing user-friendly applications or diving deep into the algorithms that power them, 
                        I approach every challenge with enthusiasm and a readiness to learn and adapt.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to apply my skills in a real-world setting through an 
                        internship. I am excited about the prospect of joining a team where I can contribute, grow, 
                        and further hone my abilities in software engineering. Beyond code, I find joy in collaborative 
                        environments where creativity and innovation flourish. Let's explore how we can make a difference 
                        together.</p>

                        <h2>Transport Management System</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">At the heart of modern logistics, my <b>Transport Management System</b> project stands as a cornerstone 
                            of innovation and efficiency. Developed using a robust stack of technologies including C#, HTML, CSS, 
                            JavaScript, and MySQL, this system is designed to streamline operations, enhance real-time 
                            communication, and improve overall logistical workflows. While there are many approaches to tackling 
                            the complexities of transport management, this project distinguishes itself through its user-centric 
                            design, scalability, and adaptability to diverse logistical challenges. The majority of existing 
                            solutions may have faced alterations in form and function, but my project aims to offer a comprehensive, 
                            reliable, and easy-to-use platform for transport management.<br>

                            adventurers and explorers like myself. Utilizing Android Studio for its wide accessibility, Java 
                            for its robust functionality, XML for intuitive layout design, and MySQL for reliable data 
                            management, I meticulously crafted an application that stands out in its field. My Trip Planner 
                            app features personalized itineraries, real-time updates, and interactive maps, all designed from 
                            the ground up to simplify and enrich travel planning. This project reflects my dedication to not 
                            only solving complex problems but also to creating user-centric solutions that evolve with their 
                            needs. It's a testament to my commitment to leveraging technology for making travel planning

                        <h2>Hoochamacallit System</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            For the Hoochamacallit System project, I took on the ambitious task of developing a simulator to model 
                            a network of specialized machines communicating with a backend server. This project, designed as a 
                            Thorton Proof-of-Concept, was a deep dive into Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms within a 
                            UNIX/Linux environment.

                            I developed three critical components: the Data Creator (DC), simulating the production machines; 
                            the Data Reader (DR), acting as the server monitoring machine statuses; and the Data Corruptor (DX), 
                            introduced to test the network's resilience under stress. Written entirely in C, this project challenged 
                            me to implement and manage complex IPC mechanisms, such as message queues and shared memory, ensuring robust 
                            and efficient communication across the system.<br>

                        <h2>Reliable UDP</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify"> 
                            In my project, I developed a UDP-based file transfer application in C++ for Windows, focusing on 
                            reliability and efficiency. A standout feature is the incorporation of a checksum validation mechanism 
                            to ensure file integrity, for which I integrated zlib's checksum functionality. This choice 
                            underscored my commitment to robust data verification. The application supports dynamic configuration, 
                            avoiding hard-coded parameters and includes an automated test to demonstrate its error-handling 
                            capabilities. With its ability to accurately measure and display transfer speeds, my project adeptly 
                            handles both ASCII and binary file transfers, showcas ing its versatility and precision in real-world 
                            scenarios.<br>

                        <h2>Logging Service</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            For this innovative project, I designed and developed a custom logging service using Python and a 
                            test client in C#, intentionally choosing different languages to demonstrate versatility and comply 
                            with project requirements. The logging service operates over a network, capable of receiving messages 
                            through TCP, chosen for its reliability in data transmission, ensuring that every log message is 
                            accurately received and recorded.
                            The architecture allows for configurable log formats and is equipped with rate limiting to prevent abuse, 
                            catering to multiple simultaneous clients without sacrificing performance. The accompanying C# test client 
                            enhances the project's utility by enabling both manual and automated testing, rigorously evaluating the service's 
                            ability to handle a diverse array of log messages and formats.<br>

                        <p style="text-align: justify">
                            I developed a client-server application which is my Academic Project designed to support multiple users concurrently 
                            in a simple yet engaging word guessing game. This application, showcasing my proficiency in 
                            C# and .NET framework, was crafted with a WPF client interface allowing users to connect to a 
                            server by entering IP address, Port number, a username, and a game time limit. Upon successful 
                            connection, the server, a multi-threaded console application also written in C#, dispatches a 
                            string of 80 characters and the total number of words to be found within this string, challenging 
                            players to identify as many correct words as possible before time expires.
                            Demonstrated on Microsoft Azure to leverage cloud-based scalability and reliability, this 
                            project not only tested my technical skills but also emphasized my commitment to user experience 
                            and software reliability. Regular commits to GitHub throughout the development process and a 
                            structured demonstration in a lab setting highlighted the project's methodical approach and 
                            attention to detail. <br>
